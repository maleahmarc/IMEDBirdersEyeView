            The first bird I identified was a Crested Caracara perched on my
            neighbor's roof. I remember spotting the large bird from the falcon
            family from my window and running with my binoculars to the backyard
            to try and identify it before it flew away. I learned the Caracara
            was a Texas native and some believe symbolizes

              courage and strength.
            </a>
            I needed the encouragement then and found that now I feel motivated
            each time spotting a Caracara.

              The National Audubon Society,

            a non-profit that protects birds and their habitats, recommends four
            steps to get started: Stop, Look, Listen, and Repeat. Birds are all
            around you, so the first step is learning to become aware of them
            and their habits.

              The National Park Service
            </a>

            recommends investing in a bird guide and binoculars when you are
            ready to start taking birding more seriously. Bird guides are
            helpful for identifying and learning about birds and are often
            arranged by color for beginners. Binoculars will also magnify
            aspects of the bird, like color and pattern, to help with
            identification.

            Another benefit to birding is feeling like you are attuned to a
            secret world happening all around. You learn which of your local
            birds is the first to sing in the morning and that many birds feed
            simultaneously at night. A cardinal sighting will make you think of
            a loved one who passed. And all of it starts by first looking for
            signs in the sky.
