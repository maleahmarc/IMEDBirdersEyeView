          Birder's Eye View was founded in 2024 by Maleah, the club president,
          after she was diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety and took up
          bird-watching as a form of mindfulness. However, when she tried to
          find bird-watching groups in San Antonio, she realized that most
          people were not in her demographic as a 22-year-old half-Filipino and
          Italian woman. So, she created Birder's Eye View to provide a space
          where young adults can try a new hobby, relax, and make new friends.
          We hope to see you around!
