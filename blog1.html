            I explored local parks after getting diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD
            last year as a mindfulness tool. My interest in birding was sparked
            after finding a Great Blue Heron, a large water bird with a six-foot
            wingspan. I discovered that birding was a free activity I could do
            anywhere and instantly feel more relaxed.

            I am not alone in this experience.

              A 2022 study published in the Scientific Reports
            </a>
            found positive associations between individuals hearing and seeing
            birds and mental well-being even after adjusting for factors like
            age, gender, ethnicity, education, and occupation. The study had
            1300 people use a smartphone app to log their feelings and set
            controls for other natural aspects like trees, plants, and seeing or
            hearing water.

              Forbes article

            also described a study done with 112 college students, which found
            that students who went birding had higher levels of self-reported
            subjective well-being and lower levels of psychological distress
            compared to those who had more common experiences in nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both studies show how birding can be beneficial to mental health.
            Birding can be a great hobby because you can do it almost anywhere
            with limited resources. If you are a college student or on a limited
            budget, birding can be an especially perfect activity to destress.
            So whether in your backyard or local park, look up and see beyond
            the sky.
