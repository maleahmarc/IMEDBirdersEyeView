            In January 2021, Texas Parks and Wildlife and Audubon Texas
            certified San Antonio as a

              Texas Bird City,
            </a>
            a city recognized for its bird conservation and environmental
            commitment. Bexar County has recorded over 400 bird species due to
            its position of converging ecological regions. The city is located
            in the migratory bird corridor called the Central Flyway, which
            brings different birds in the Spring and Fall. Lastly, San Antonio’s
            parks, greenways, and other nature habitats are a refuge for birds
            in the city. These factors make San Antonio a great spot for
            spotting varieties of birds throughout the year.
          </p>

            My favorite park to bird in is
            <a href="https://friendscbnp.zenfolio.com/gallery" target="_blank">
              Cresent Bend Nature Park,
            </a>
            which, as of May 1st, 2024, reported 270 bird sightings. The park is
            located on Schaefer Road in the City of Schertz, south of Cibolo
            Creek. The park also hosts two bird blinds, places meant to draw
            birds and hide you from view.
            <a
              href="https://www.saaudubon.org/birding-sites/#cbpark"
              target="_blank"
            >
              Species
            </a>
            you can find in the park include migratory birds in the spring and
            fall, sparrows in the winter, flycatchers, woodpeckers, and raptors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another popular birding spot is the
            <a href="https://mitchelllake.audubon.org/birds" target="_blank">
              Mitchell Lake Audubon Center,
            </a>
            a wildlife refuge designated by the City of San Antonio. The
            center’s three bodies of water, including stormwater ponds and
            lakes, have documented over 300 bird species. Thirty of those
            species are also considered to have the highest conservation needs.
            Michell Lake is also vital for migratory birds as it’s the only
            mud-flat habitat necessary for shorebirds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re a backyard birder or seek out different birds, San
            Antonio is a great city to see various birds wherever you go. As
            Fall approaches, be sure to be on the lookout for different
            migratory birds stopping on their journey here!
